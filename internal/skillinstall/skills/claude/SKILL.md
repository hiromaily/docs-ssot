# docs-ssot: Documentation SSOT Setup

This skill migrates existing Markdown documentation into a modular Single Source of Truth (SSOT) structure managed by `docs-ssot`, then builds and validates the output.

## When to use this skill

- You have existing documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, etc.) to manage as SSOT
- You want to set up `docs-ssot` in a new or existing repository
- You want to regenerate documentation after editing source templates

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Check prerequisites

Verify `docs-ssot` is installed:

```sh
docs-ssot version
```

If not installed:

```sh
# Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew tap hiromaily/tap && brew install docs-ssot

# or Go install
go install github.com/hiromaily/docs-ssot/cmd/docs-ssot@latest
```

---

### Step 2 — Identify existing documentation files

List Markdown files in the repository root:

```sh
ls *.md
```

Common candidates: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`

---

### Step 3 — Preview the migration plan

Run a dry-run to see what sections will be created without writing any files:

```sh
docs-ssot migrate --dry-run README.md CLAUDE.md
```

Review the output to understand:
- How many sections will be created and their categories
- Which sections are detected as duplicates (shared across files)
- The proposed template structure under `template/sections/` and `template/pages/`

---

### Step 4 — Run the migration

Migrate the identified files:

```sh
docs-ssot migrate README.md CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md
```

This will:
1. Split each file by H2 headings into section files under `template/sections/<category>/`
2. Create template files under `template/pages/` with `@include` directives
3. Create or update `docsgen.yaml` with build targets
4. Verify round-trip: build and compare output against originals

---

### Step 5 — Review the generated structure

```sh
docs-ssot index
```

Inspect:
- `template/sections/` — modular section files (**edit these, not the generated outputs**)
- `template/pages/*.tpl.md` — template files defining document structure
- `docsgen.yaml` — build targets mapping templates to output files

---

### Step 6 — Build documentation

Regenerate all output files from the templates:

```sh
docs-ssot build
# or, if a Makefile target exists:
make docs
```

---

### Step 7 — Validate

Check that all include directives resolve correctly:

```sh
docs-ssot validate
```

---

### Step 8 — Check for SSOT violations

Scan for near-duplicate sections that should be merged into a single source:

```sh
docs-ssot check
```

If duplicates are found, consolidate the content into one section file under `template/sections/` and update the templates to reference it with `@include`.

---

## Key Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `docs-ssot migrate <files>` | Decompose existing docs into SSOT section structure |
| `docs-ssot migrate --dry-run <files>` | Preview migration without writing files |
| `docs-ssot build` | Generate all output files from templates |
| `docs-ssot validate` | Check all include directives resolve |
| `docs-ssot check` | Detect near-duplicate sections (SSOT violations) |
| `docs-ssot index` | Show include relationships and orphan detection |
| `docs-ssot include <template>` | Expand and print a template to stdout (debugging) |

---

## Editing documentation after migration

After migration, the ongoing workflow is:

1. Edit source files in `template/sections/`
2. Run `docs-ssot build` to regenerate outputs
3. Verify with `git diff README.md`

**Never edit** `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `AGENTS.md` directly — they are overwritten on every build.

---

## docsgen.yaml structure

```yaml
targets:
  - input: template/pages/README.tpl.md
    output: README.md
  - input: template/pages/CLAUDE.tpl.md
    output: CLAUDE.md
```

Add or remove targets to control which output files are generated.

---

## Include directive syntax

Templates use include directives to compose sections:

```markdown
<!-- @include: sections/project/overview.md -->
<!-- @include: sections/development/ -->
<!-- @include: sections/**/*.md level=+1 -->
```

The optional `level=+N` parameter adjusts heading depth of the included content.
