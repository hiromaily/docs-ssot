## Overview

`docs-ssot` is a documentation Single Source of Truth (SSOT) generator.

It composes files such as README.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and other AI agent instruction files from small modular Markdown files.

---

## Background

AI-assisted development and AI agents are becoming a standard part of software development workflows.  
Different AI tools and agents require different instruction and context files, for example:

- README.md
- AGENTS.md
- CLAUDE.md
- Agent-specific rule files like `.claude/rules`, `.cursor/rules`
- Development guidelines
- Architecture documentation

As the number of AI tools increases (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc.), maintaining these files becomes difficult.

Common problems include:

- Documentation duplication
- Inconsistent information across files
- Outdated documentation
- Manual copy & paste maintenance
- Documentation drift over time

Maintaining multiple documentation files without duplication becomes increasingly difficult.

---

## Problem

Documentation should follow the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) principle, but Markdown alone has limited reuse and composition capabilities.

Markdown is easy to write but lacks:

- File composition
- Reusable documentation modules
- Document templating
- Shared sections across multiple documents
- Structured documentation assembly

As a result, teams often duplicate content across multiple Markdown files.

---

## Solution

`docs-ssot` solves this problem by introducing:

- Modular Markdown documentation
- Template-based document structure
- Include directives for Markdown files
- Generated documentation files
- Single Source of Truth documentation architecture

Instead of writing large README files directly, documentation is split into small reusable Markdown modules and assembled into final documents using templates.

---

## Concept

The documentation workflow changes from this:

```
Manually write:

- README.md
- AGENTS.md
- CLAUDE.md
```

To this:

```
Write small docs in docs/
  ↓
Use templates
  ↓
docs-ssot build
  ↓
Generate README.md / AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md
```

This ensures:

- No duplication
- Consistent documentation
- Easier updates
- Scalable documentation structure
- AI-friendly documentation organization
